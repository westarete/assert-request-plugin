* Improve rdoc documentation for public use. README should cover
  justification, installation, and how to handle the resulting exceptions.
  The assert_request method should be documented with the actual usage and
  examples.

* Make new release.

* Blog, post, comment, and email about it. Seek suggestions for improvement.

* I think that forms using alternate methods in forms (such as :method =>
  :put) still show up as request.method == :post.

* (Maybe) Support for regular expressions, e.g. :email => /\w+@\w+/ . Not
  useful for user input (use validation instead), but might be handy for when
  accepting action-to-action arguments (e.g. hidden form fields) that
  shouldn't be messed with.

* Verify that RESTful aspects (the stuff after the semicolon) are supported
  properly. This should be handled at the routing level though, so it should
  be OK -- the stuff after the semicolon should simply get interpreted as the
  action.
