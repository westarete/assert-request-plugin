* Wrap public methods in their own module, so that we only have to import
  *them* into the application controller, rather than all of our code.

* Tests don't seem to run at all under win32 native.

* Make new release.

* Blog, post, comment, and email about it. Seek suggestions for improvement.

* (Undecided) Syntactic sugar: Support string-based declarations for nested
  elements. This is more succinct than block notation when the number of
  nested params is small. Example:

    assert_params_must_have "[:fido][:name]"
    
  would be equivalent to:
  
    assert_params_must_have :fido { |f| f.must_have :name }

* How to handle collections? OK with using plain ruby? or add extra support?
