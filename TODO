* Support nested hashes for param_requirements and param_options.
* Support for aspects (REST)
* Support ActiveRecord models as a shortcut for specifying subhashes. This
  is useful for forms, where most of the parameters match the attributes of
  an ActiveRecord model. For example:

  class CatController < ActionController::Base
    ...
    def update
      # Requests to this action must be via the POST method, must have an
      # integer :id argument, and must have a :cat argument, whose value is
      # a hash of keys and values that correspond to the attributes of the
      # Cat model that's being updated.
      validate_request(:post, {:id => :integer, :cat => Cat})
      ...
    end
    ...
  end
