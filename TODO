* Change exception hierarchy, so that it matches this concept:
  http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/3/7/raising-the-right-exception
  Stop using RuntimeError, and instead use two flavors of descendents of 
  our own custom exception class.

* Tests don't seem to run at all under win32 native.

* Make new release.

* Blog, post, comment, and email about it. Seek suggestions for improvement.

* (Undecided) Syntactic sugar: Support string-based declarations for nested
  elements. This is more succinct than block notation when the number of
  nested params is small. Example:

    assert_params_must_have "[:fido][:name]"
    
  would be equivalent to:
  
    assert_params_must_have :fido { |f| f.must_have :name }

* How to handle collections? OK with using plain ruby? or add extra support?
