* Support for "enumerated types", e.g. :colors => ['red', 'blue', 'green']
* Support for regular expressions, e.g. :email => /\w+@\w+/ . This isn't 
  useful for user input (use validation instead), but would be handy for when
  accepting action-to-action arguments (e.g. hidden form fields) that 
  shouldn't be messed with.
* Support for RESTful aspects (the stuff after the semicolon)
* Support for :boolean type
* Support for protocol :http and :https
* Right now, block doesn't support adding nested arguments in multiple 
  declarations. So instead of this:
	assert_request do |r|
	  r.required :name => {:first => :string}
	  r.required :name => {:last  => :string}
	end
  you have to do this:
	assert_request do |r|
	  r.required :name => {:first => :string, :last => :string}
	end
* Deprecate calling assert_request without a block -- the syntax is too
  complex to do gracefully in one statement (e.g. :except).
