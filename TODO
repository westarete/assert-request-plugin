* Support for forms that use arrays of objects, e.g. "name[]" param, which 
  would be specified as:  r.require :name => {[] => Name}
* Forms using :method => :put still seem to show up as request.method == :post.
* Allow override of default set of params to ignore.
* Support for RESTful aspects (the stuff after the semicolon)?
* Support for regular expressions, e.g. :email => /\w+@\w+/ . Not useful for 
  user input (use validation instead), but might be handy for when accepting 
  action-to-action arguments (e.g. hidden form fields) that shouldn't be 
  messed with.
