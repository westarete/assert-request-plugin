* Support for "enumerated types", e.g. :colors => ['red', 'blue', 'green']
* Support for regular expressions, e.g. :email => /\w+@\w+/ . 
  These two previous items aren't useful for user input (use validation 
  instead), but might be handy for when accepting action-to-action arguments
  (e.g. hidden form fields) that shouldn't be messed with.
* Support for RESTful aspects (the stuff after the semicolon)
