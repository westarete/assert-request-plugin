* Support for aspects (REST)

* Support ActiveRecord models as a shortcut for specifying subhashes. This
  is useful for forms, where most of the parameters match the attributes of
  an ActiveRecord model. For example:

  class DogController < ActionController::Base
    ...
    # A typical update method for a class that controls Dogs.
    def update
      # Requests to this action must be via the POST method, must have an
      # integer :id argument, and must have a :dog argument, whose value is
      # a hash that corresponds to the attributes of the Dog model.
      validate_request(:post, {:id => :integer, :dog => Dog})
      ...
    end
    ...
  end
