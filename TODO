* Support for "enumerated types", e.g. :admin => ['t', 'f']
* Support for regular expressions, e.g. :email => /\w+@\w+/ . This isn't 
  useful for user input (use validation instead), but would be handy for when
  accepting action-to-action arguments that shouldn't be messed with.
* Support for RESTful aspects (the stuff after the semicolon)
* Support for all basic ActiveRecord types, beyond :text and :integer.
* Support for protocol (http vs https)
* Implement block-style declarations for better readability, e.g.:
	assert_valid_request do
	  method   :get, :post			# either method OK
	  protocol :https			# require SSL
	  required :id, :page, :visible		# don't care about values
	  required :email_ownership_id => :integer
	  required :email => {:address => :string}
	  optional :horizontal => :boolean
	  optional :author => Author
	end
