* Improve rdoc documentation for public use. README should cover
  justification, installation, and how to handle the resulting exceptions.
  The assert_request method should be documented with the actual usage and
  examples. Still to do:
    * README
    * must_have
    * may_have
    * must_not_have

* Make new release.

* Blog, post, comment, and email about it. Seek suggestions for improvement.

* (Undecided) Syntactic sugar: Support string-based declarations for nested
  elements. This is more succinct than block notation when the number of
  nested params is small. Example:

    assert_params_must_have "[:fido][:name]"
    
  would be equivalent to:
  
    assert_params_must_have :fido { |f| f.must_have :name }

* How to handle collections? OK with using plain ruby? or add extra support?
