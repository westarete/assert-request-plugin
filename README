== AssertRequest

This plugin provides an easy way to make sure that your rails actions are 
only called with the method, protocol, and parameters that you expect. 

This can save a considerable amount of error-checking code, uncover hidden
bugs, and prevent security holes. 

For example, here's a typical update action:

  def update
    @person = Person.find params[:id]
    if @person.update_attributes(params[:person])
      flash[:notice] = 'Person was successfully updated.'
      redirect_to :action => 'show', :id => @person
    else
      render :action => 'edit'
    end
  end

This code works fine as long as the request is always well formed, but we need
to plan for incomplete, broken, or simply strange requests, both intentional
and unintentional.

If we were to hand-code all of the contingencies that we might run into while
dealing with anonymous input from the request, we'd have a pretty messy action
that's littered with lots of conditions for detecting and dealing with bad
parameters. 

Instead, we can call assert_request at the beginning of the method to make
sure that the request contains exactly what we expect. This makes the code far
more robust, and saves us from writing a considerable amount of error-checking
code. Here's an example of how we might use assert_request on the same action:

  def update
    assert_request do |r|
      r.method :post
      r.params.must_have :id, Person
    end
    # the rest of the action is unchanged
  end

We've now ensured several things for this action:

* The request method must be POST
* The params hash contains an "id" attribute
* The params hash contains a "person" attribute whose value is a hash that 
  represents the Person model

assert_request examines the Person model, and expands it in place as if you'd
specified all of its attributes by hand.

Now if we receive a request that doesn't match our specification, then the
application will raise a RequestError exception, and we'll get a detailed
message in the logs. In development mode, the exception and its explanation
will be displayed in the browser. In production mode, a 404 Not Found response
is returned.

If assert_request seems too heavy-handed for your needs, this plugin also
includes the methods AssertRequest#assert_params_must_have,
AssertRequest#assert_method, and AssertRequest#assert_protocol, which are much
more succinct to use, and have more specific uses.

For all of the details on usage, see AssertRequest#assert_request

Finally, the plugin includes a patch for the rails scaffold generators, so 
that they include the appropriate calls to assert_request. This might save 
some time, and it can be a good way to see the plugin in actual use.

== Installation

Install the plugin by running the following commands from your rails
application's directory:

  ./script/plugin source svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/validaterequest/plugins
  ./script/plugin install assert_request

That's it. You're ready to add calls to assert_request to your actions.
